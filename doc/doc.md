## Introduction

Indie Studio (Bomberman) is a 3D action game.
This project aims to recreate the game Bomberman.
The object of the game is to drop bombs on a grid in order to destroy your opponents.
The gameplay is relatively simple, easy to implement.
The project is carried out in groups of 6 people.
Each person has their own way of working, it is necessary to find the right working method.
We had to recreate the whole design, and think about how our game will work.

## Organisation

Once we separated the work into small tasks so that each member of the group knows what they have to do, we started working.
We immediately saw that the best solution for this kind of project is to create an ECS type architecture.
We had meetings very often and we tried to work together as much as possible so that everything was implemented well and that no one was doing the same work as someone else.

## Design

I think what differentiates our project from those of others is the fact that all the designs of characters, bombs or even bonuses are entirely made by us.

## Raylib

Raylib is a cross-platform open-source software development library. The library was made to create graphical applications and games.
Raylib has received several recognitions in recent years. Here there are some awards received from Google and Epic Games.
On this part we did not have too many problems, the documentation was quite complete. In addition, the community is very responsive and present.

## Difficulties

At the organizational level, It's a big group. It's also a pretty big project.
The Raylib library was something new for us so required some time to learn. Initiation to 3D we had never seen before.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we would like to thank Simon for his invaluable help and advice during the follow-ups.
We had fun doing this project. Teamwork worked well.
